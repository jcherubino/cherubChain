# cherubChain
Mini implementation of simple blockchain written in pure C for *nix systems (probably).

## Roadmap

- [X] Implement chain structure as linked list (store some arbitrary transaction as string)
- [X] Implement hash function
- [X] Implement dynamically adding node
- [X] Implement printing out list locally
- [ ] Implement client/server socket interface to perform actions with node. 
    - [X] Get chain
    - [X] Add transaction
    - [ ] Add node
- [ ] Implement peer to peer network to allow nodes to interface
- [ ] Implement consensus algorithm
- [ ] Add proof of ... for blocks to be mined
- [ ] Upgrade internal hashing to use cryptographic hash function

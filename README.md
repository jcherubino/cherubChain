Mini implementation of simple blockchain written in pure C for *nix systems (probably).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement chain structure as linked list (store some arbitrary transaction as string)
- [ ] Implement hash function
- [ ] Implement dynamically adding node
- [ ] Implement printing out list locally
- [ ] Implement HTTP server to perform actions with node. Use json format or xml format
    - [ ] Get chain
    - [ ] Add transaction
    - [ ] Add node
- [ ] Implement peer to peer network to allow nodes to interface
- [ ] Implement consensus algorithm
- [ ] Add proof of ... for blocks to be mined
